/**
 * Native LiveKit media-transport layer for CN CALL.
 *
 * PHASE 1.5-D: ACTIVE transport built on the livekit-android 2.11.0 SDK that
 * is already on the Gradle classpath (mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts).
 *
 * Scope (per the architecture report):
 *   - LiveKit is the PASSIVE RTP/media transport only. This file contains no
 *     call-state machine, no signalling, no Telecom, no AudioManager calls and
 *     no Flutter UI.
 *   - Android Telecom owns audio focus, routing and the microphone lifecycle.
 *     To keep the SDK out of that domain, livekit-android is created with
 *     `AudioOptions(audioHandler = NoAudioHandler())` so it never requests
 *     audio focus, never sets MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION and never drives
 *     speaker/earpiece routing (the default AudioSwitchHandler does all three).
 *
 * Remote audio is played automatically by the SDK's JavaAudioDeviceModule on
 * article subscription (2.11.0 needs no explicit track.start() on Android).
 *
 * The public API below is preserved from the Phase 1 placeholder. The only
 * addition is [initialize], which must be called once with an application
 * Context before the first [connect] because this singleton has no other way
 * to obtain one for [LiveKit.create].

 *     derived server-side from the token).
 *   - setMicrophoneEnabled() maps to LocalParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled,
 *     which publishes/unmutes or mutes the local audio track (LiveKit only).
 *   - setSpeaker() is intentionally a no-op in this phase (see below).
 *   - disconnect() leaves + releases the room; it never sends hangup/reject/
 *     cancel and never touches signalling or Telecom.
 *   - Thread safety: all state transitions are guarded by [lock]; a monotonic
 *     [generation] invalidates callbacks/collectors from a superseded Room so
 *     a stale room can never flip the state of a newer connection.
